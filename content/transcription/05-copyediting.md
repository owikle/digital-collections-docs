Returning to the window with your audio file:
- Adjust the speed of the recording to your preference by hitting the ellipses
- Edit directly in your spreadsheet, minding speaker names, dialogue and accuracy of the tags
- Don’t overthink it! If you’ve given a portion of dialogue two or three passes and still can’t figure out what is being said, it is `(unintelligible)`
- If you are identifying underlying themes that are not present in the current tags, build them into the `Name Location Tags` spreadsheet or remove words or tags that aren’t pertinent and simply run the Apps Script again to make those changes
- If there are one off adjustments you need to make to the tags, make them in the addition or subtraction fields so they aren’t overwritten in the AppScript. I will review before importing into the collection and make those final changes.
- When you’ve finished copy editing and tagging the csv, please return to the project management spreadsheet and initial in the “copy edit finished” field

**Note for bilingual recordings**: the translation field is a formula, so when you adjust the wording in Spanish, English should automatically correct itself. If the English field is still incorrect, copy the field then `paste as values` and adjust the text as needed.
