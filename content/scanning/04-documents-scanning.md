- The directions are similar to [scanning an image]({{ '/content/scanning/03-images-scanning.html' | relative_url }}), but with different requirements.  

- All documents should be scanned at **400 dpi** with the color filter set to **"none"**. 

- All documents should be scanned to JPEG format, not TIFF. 

- Depending on the size of the document and the scanner used, the Color Separation Guide should be used following the same guidelines recommended when scanning images (Color Separation Guides will not be used on the feed scanner.) Please ask CDIL staff if this applies to your project.

- Use the standard [File Naming]({{ '/content/scanning/02-filenaming.html' | relative_url }}) conventions for scanning items.

- Once a folder, box, or project is completely scanned, convert the files to PDF using the [Document Processing guide]({{ '/content/processing/02-documents-processing.html' | relative_url }}).
