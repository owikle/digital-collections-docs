Every item you scan needs a file name! A standardized file naming system helps us know exactly where an item came from or where it belongs just by looking at the file name. Scanned files should be named using the following standardized naming rules:

**collectionabbreviation_box#_envelope/folder#-item#subitem**
{:.text-center}

- Filenames should be all lowercase.

Examples:
- Manuscript Group 190, Box 4, Folder 2, letter 1, multiple pages = **mg190_b4_f2-001p001, mg190_b4_f2-001p002, etc.**
- Photograph Group 3, box 1, photograph 3 = **pg3_b1-003**
