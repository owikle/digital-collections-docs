**Before you scan**:
Make sure that hands are clean and dry when handling materials. All materials should be handled with care, and cotton gloves should be worn when instructed by a supervisor. These items cannot be replaced or easily repaired if damaged or destroyed.

## Why do we scan?

Digitizing materials is sometimes the safest and most effective means of preserving the information in an item. Scanning items at a high resolution allows the item to be used in different ways without handling the actual item. This is why we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image; it provides a scalable image that can be used for large or small reprints while maintaining the original details of the item.

## File Specifications

See the table below for an overview of the specifications at which we scan and process each item type.
