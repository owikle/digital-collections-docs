## Why do we scan?

Digitizing materials by scanning them with a flatbed, large format, or feed scanner is sometimes the safest and most effective means of preserving the information in an item and allowing others to access it. Scanning items at a high resolution allows the item to be used in different ways without needing to make any manipulations to the actual item. This is why we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image; it provides a scalable image that can be used for large or small reprints while maintaining the original details of the item.

## File Specifications

See the table below for an overview of the specifications at which we scan and transform each item type.
