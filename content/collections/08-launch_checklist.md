---

When a new collection is completed (review and QC done) or significant updates are made to an existing collection, follow these steps to ensure we effectively communicate and share the new resource. [Link to doc version.](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/shared/Teams/Digital%20Collections%20Team/resources/digital_collection_launch_checklist.docx?d=w27bd9d877fe048659d48e1b1f9d42a1d&csf=1&web=1&e=SYLObQ)

Ensure there is a point person for the collection. The point person will lead a collection through the launch process. Discuss at DC Team if necessary to clarify.
