As you work on your collection branch, be sure to [Commit your changes and Push regularly](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/repository/commit/#commit--push-changes).
Note, the first time you push a new branch to GitHub, the message from GitHub Desktop or VS Code will be about "publishing" your branch--this will make it available on GitHub.
Use meaningful commit messages to ensure collaborators (and your future self) understand what you were doing. 

Using your local server, test your collection in your browser clicking on links and all pages to ensure features are working as expected and all items are displaying.
Often, exploring the collection will point out issues in the metadata that you will want to go back and fix--this is an iterative process!

Do not hesitate to reach out for help debugging issues! 

## Publish

Once the collection is ready, submit it to the CDIL team via the [Collection Update Form](https://forms.office.com/r/8S0dZ8viDJ).

The Digital Projects Manager and Digital Initiatives Librarian will prep it for final publication:

- Check over the branch code.
- Merge any updates from `main` if necessary.
- Send collection to DC QC process.
- Guide collection into launch checklist.
