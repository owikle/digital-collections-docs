Each Digital Collections consist of several parts:

- Objects: the digitized files such as jpgs, pdfs, mp3s, etc.
- Metadata: the spreadsheet describing the items.
- CollectionBuilder template: a branch in collection template or separate project repository.

This "Creating Collections" section describes the workflow for setting up a new collection using one of our standard templates at U of I library.

Most Digital Collections team members will not regularly need to complete the full process to create a new collection--many of the steps will be completed by core maintainers, with collaborators focusing on objects, metadata, and interpretive content. 

Overview of the process:

1. Prepare collection objects and metadata.
2. CDIL team loads prepared objects to libobjects server.
3. Select collection template.
4. Create new branch for collection. 
5. Add metadata CSV to "_data" folder.
6. Configure collection's "_config.yml".
7. Configure pages and nav.
8. Write interpretive content in "about.md".
9. Test on local machine (ongoing).
10. Notify CDIL team to publish to live web.
11. DC QC process.
12. Promote!

Note: the complete process to create a collection from a generic template is described in the [CB-Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/).
These docs describe the process in the context of our customized templates and workflow.
