*This guide is intended as a reference for U of I faculty outside of the CDIL (Special Collections, Fellowships, etc).*

Each Digital Collections consist of several parts:

- Digitized objects (images, pdfs, etc)
- Metadata (spreadsheet describing the items)
- Branch in collection template or separate project repository (the CollectionBuilder code)

Other sections of these Docs describe the workflows for creating objects and metadata, this section describes how to set up a new collection in our templates.

To develop and test collections you will need some software installed on your local computer. 
Before proceeding through these steps, you will first need to [install all of the items specified in the  software](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/) section of our main CB docs, including creating a GitHub account and installing a Visual Studio Code.
