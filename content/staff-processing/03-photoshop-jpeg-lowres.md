title: Batch Convert Jpeg Size
---

The CDIL uses an action in Adobe Photoshop to run a batch process to produce 300 dpi Jpeg copies of the full resolution processed Jpeg files. The 300 dpi Jpeg files are smaller in size and suitable for web publication.

**Note**: Non-batch related instructions for processing material can be found on the [Processing Images]({{ '/content/processing/02-images-processing.html' | relative_url }}) and [Processing Documents]({{ '/content/processing/03-documents-processing.html' | relative_url }}) pages.
