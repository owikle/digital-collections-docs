When you have made all of the adjustments you would like, reach out to the Digital Projects Manager or Digital Initiatives Librarian and they can launch the site for you. This consists of: 
- Deploying the site onto our server
- Sending the collection around for quality control review 
- Working through the collection launch outreach checklist. 

If and when you need to update either the metadata or objects, repeat the processes in the **Developing Locally, Configuration and Committing** section. Let the previously mentioned contacts know when the draft is ready and they can redeploy the site.
