## Equipment Recommendation

The type of scanner you will need depends on the type of items you plan to scan. The CDIL recommends using a flatbed scanner to scan your items as any type of feed scanner has potential to damage delicate photos and documents. Look for a scanner with a bed size that will fit the largest of the items you'll be scanningâ€”something that's at least 8 1/2" x 11" will typically work unless you have many oversize items. If you'll be scanning slides and/or film, also opt for a scanner with a built-in transparency unit. For high-quality scans, you'll also need something capable of scanning at at least 600 dpi. 

## Scanning Specifications

In the CDIL we use very specific specifications to create archival quality scans:

- **DPI**: DPI, or dots per inch, measures the resolution of a digital scan. A higher dpi equates to a higher resolution scan. We scan images at 600 dpi and documents at 400 dpi.
- **Pixels**: We scan all items at 6,000 pixels on the longest edge of the item. 
- **File type**: We scan all items to .tiff format first. TIFF files are meant to preserve the quality of a scan and are inherently large. TIFF files are optimal for storing digital images; for sharing images on the web, you'll want to convert them to a lower resolution JPEG. 

## Processing Images

After you have your items scanned, there are a few different things you can do to process and build your collection:

- **Photoshop**: The CDIL uses Adobe Photoshop to process the digital files from our scanning projects. Visit the [Processing]({{ '/content/processing/01-processing.html' | relative_url }}) instructions for a guide to these procedures.
- **GIMP**: If you don't have access to Photoshop, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free image editing software with similar functions.
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) is also a good free resource for image optimization
- **Metadata**: Once your images are processed, you might want to create some metadata to describe your images. Visit the [Metadata]({{ '/content/metadata/02-metadata.html' | relative_url }}) page to see some common metadata fields that we use for our collections. We recommend using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to create your metadata.
