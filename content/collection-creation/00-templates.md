Digital Collection Template Repositories

Guidelines:

- Most digital collections are generated from a template repository. 
    - In template repositories each collection is represented in a branch.
    - The main branch is a generic base. The main branch is updated, and updates are merged into collection branches.
    - In branches all customizations should be made by creating new layouts or display templates to avoid issues with updating.
    - "digital-collections-team" and "digital-maintainers" teams should have write access to all template repositories. Do not add individual collaborators (this makes it easier to maintain access).
- Highly customized collections, usually digital scholarship projects with lots of unique content, are generally an individual repository. Most of these repositories are in thecdil organization rather than uidaholib.
- While collaborating with outside people on a project, it should be in its own repository. Once a collection is stabilized in development, it could move into a template repository if not highly customized.

## Current Templates

Current templates are divided into a set of content specific groups.
These templates are intended to gradually diverge with features specific to each content type over time.

- [ijc-collection-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/ijc-collection-template) - International Jazz Collections
- [campus-collections-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/campus-collections-template) - highlighted campus collections
- [base-digital-collections-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/base-digital-collections-template) - general collections (photographs)
- [documents-digital-collections-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/documents-digital-collections-template) - for document-centric collections
- [oral-history-collections-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/oral-history-collections-template) - base enhanced with OHD features
- *possible:* community collections? collections originating with partner collections? (priest lake, lchs, potlatch)
