title: What is Metadata?
---

Metadata is the information we create to describe each item in our collections.
We follow standards to make sure that our descriptions are consistent across items and ensure that users can find what they're searching for. 

We follow the [Dublin Core Metadata Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core), which provide us a standard for how we format our metadata and make the information readable for a large audience. 
The [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/content/metadata/02-metadata.html' | relative_url }}) will further cover the details of the different formats for all common sections of a metadata spreadsheet that technicians will encounter. 

Not all of the fields listed below will appear on every metadata spreadsheet.
Some metadata spreadsheets will have extra fields depending on the subject material.
As a general rule, though, these are the most common fields you will encounter when entering metadata.
It may seem like a lot of information, but each field serves a purpose for both preservation and access.

If you have questions, please refer to CDIL staff.
