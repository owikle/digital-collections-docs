title: What is Metadata?
---

Metadata is the information we create to describe each item in our collections. We follow standards to make sure that our descriptions are consistent across items and ensure that users can find what theyâ€™re searching for.

We follow the [Dublin Core Metadata Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core), which provide us with a standard for how we organize our data down to the essential elements when researchers are using our digital collections. 

Not all of the following fields will appear on every metadata spreadsheet. Some spreadsheets will have extra fields depending on the subject material. As a general rule, though, these are the most common fields you will encounter. It may seem like a lot of information, but each field serves a purpose for both preservation and access.

If you have questions, please refer to CDIL staff.
