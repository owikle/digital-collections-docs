This section of the docs presents some more advanced processes and reference for infrastructure details that will be most relevant to the CDIL team.

Maintainers are the people who have full access to the web servers and github code, who will manage the ongoing development, deployment, and maintenance of Digital Collections. 

The [uidaholib/digital-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/uidaholib/teams/digital-maintainers) and [thecdil/digital-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/thecdil/teams/digital-maintainers) GitHub org teams are used to ensure this group has full access to all github projects.
