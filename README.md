# UIdaho Digital Collections Documentation

This site contains documentation for the faculty, staff, and students that make up the University of Idaho Library's Digital Collections Team.
It features workflows related to the digitization, processing, and description of objects, and the curation of those objects into a contextualized digital collection.

For examples and for more information, see the University of Idaho [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and [Library Website](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/).

This site was developed using the [Learn-Static Lesson Template](https://github.com/learn-static/lesson-template).
